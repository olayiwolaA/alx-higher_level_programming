`Python` `OOP`
## :open_book: Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
* How to serialize and deserialize a Class
* How to write and read a JSON file
* What is `*args` and how to use it
* What is `**kwargs` and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function\
## Tasks
### 0. If it's not tested it doesn't work
All your files, classes and methods must be unit tested and be PEP 8 validated.
### 1. Base class
Write the first class `Base`:
### 2. First Rectangle
Write the class `Rectangle` that inherits from `Base`:
### 3. Validate attributes
Update the class `Rectangle` by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (`id` excluded):
### 4. Area first
Update the class `Rectangle` by adding the public method `def area(self):` that returns the area value of the `Rectangle` instance.
