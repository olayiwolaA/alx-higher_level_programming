# 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
## :open_book: Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* Why Python programming is awesome
* What are sets and how to use them
* What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
* When to use sets versus lists
* How to iterate into a set
* What are dictionaries and how to use them
* When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
* What is a key in a dictionary
* How to iterate over a dictionary
* What is a lambda function
* What are the map, reduce and filter functions
## Tasks
### 0. Squared simple
Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
* Prototype: `def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):`
* `matrix` is a 2 dimensional array
### 1. Search and replace
Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
* Prototype: `def search_replace(my_list, search, replace):`
### 2. Unique addition
Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).
* Prototype: `def uniq_add(my_list=[]):`
### 3. Present in both
Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
* Prototype: `def common_elements(set_1, set_2):`
### 4. Only differents
Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
* Prototype: `def only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2):`
### 5. Number of keys
Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
* Prototype: `def number_keys(a_dictionary):`
### 6. Print sorted dictionary
Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
* Prototype: `def print_sorted_dictionary(a_dictionary):`
### 7. Update dictionary
Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
* Prototype: `def update_dictionary(a_dictionary, key, value):`
### 8. Simple delete by key
Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
* Prototype: `def simple_delete(a_dictionary, key=""):`
### 9. Multiply by 2
Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2
* Prototype: `def multiply_by_2(a_dictionary):`
### 10. Best score
Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
* Prototype: `def best_score(a_dictionary):`
### 11. Multiply by using map
Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.
* Prototype: `def multiply_list_map(my_list=[], number=0):`
### 12. Roman to Integer
**Technical interview preparation:**
* You are not allowed to google anything
* Whiteboard first
Create a function `def roman_to_int(roman_string):` that converts a [Roman numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) to an integer.
* You can assume the number will be between 1 to 3999.
* `def roman_to_int(roman_string)` must return an integer
* If the `roman_string` is not a string or `None`, return 0
